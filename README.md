## TFS Legacy Components for BuildMaster

This extension contains the legacy components (legacy plan actions, etc.) for use in BuildMaster v6.0 and later that were formerly included with the [TFS](https://github.com/inedo/inedox-tfs) extension. 

Installations that do not use any [legacy features](https://inedo.com/support/kb/1144/buildmaster-legacy-features) do not need to install this extension.
